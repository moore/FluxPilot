# FluxPilot

FluxPilot will be designed to make custom LED animations accessible to everyone. The project's primary goal is to provide an inexpensive controller board (targeting a price of around $5 USD) alongside user-friendly software, enabling users without technical experience to easily create animations.

FluxPilot's initial audience will include prop makers, cosplayers, and hobbyists who aren't comfortable with electronics or programming.

Although existing solutions like [WLED](https://kno.wled.ge/) and [Pixelblaze](https://electromage.com/pixelblaze) offer powerful tools, they typically require more expensive controllers ($15â€“$30 USD) and programming skills to create custom animations.

FluxPilot will draw inspiration from user-interface concepts found in music production and animation software, allowing users to build complex animations without writing code.
